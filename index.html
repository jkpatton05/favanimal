    <p> One of my favorite dogs is the German Shepherd Lab mix because that is what my dog, Bosco, is. He is loyal, protective, and smart. He alerts us when anyone is near our door. He is also very affectionate to anyone who comes by regularly, but will warm up to strangers if he sees that we accept them. We also have chihuahuas he gets along with.</p>
